# Coding Practice

This is a compilation of coding exercises from diverse sources.

The intention of this repo is to make me accountable to resolve at least one problem on a daily basis and to share my
solutions. I do not expect to fully optimize the code or to get the better solution for problems. What I expect
to do is to write code easy to read and understand.
